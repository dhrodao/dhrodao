I'm Daniel Hervas a Telematics Engineering student living in Spain. I spend the most of my time researching, coding and watching videos about tech, videogames and some other cool stuff.

Right now, I'm currently working on my undergraduate thesis, that consists on a proyect for Unibotics and RoboticsAcademy introducing webRTC technologies to their environment.
